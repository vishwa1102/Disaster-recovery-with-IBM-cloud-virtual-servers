## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive disaster recovery plan for IBM Cloud Virtual Servers. In today's technology-driven world, ensuring the availability and integrity of your applications and data is of utmost importance. This disaster recovery plan outlines the procedures and best practices to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing this disaster recovery plan, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **IBM Cloud Account:** You should have an active IBM Cloud account to provision and manage Virtual Servers.
- **IBM Cloud Virtual Servers:** Virtual servers that host your applications and data.
- **Understanding of Data Dependencies:** Have a clear understanding of your application architecture and data dependencies. Identify critical systems and data that need to be protected.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

Our disaster recovery plan is designed around a multi-region setup to ensure high availability and resilience. Here's a high-level overview:

- **Primary Data Center:** This is where your primary virtual servers reside, serving your applications.
- **Secondary Data Center:** In a different geographical region from the primary, this data center serves as a failover location.
- **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic between the primary and secondary data centers.
- **Data Replication:** Continuous data replication from the primary to secondary data center ensures data consistency.
- **Automated Failover:** In the event of a disaster, a set of automated scripts and procedures will trigger the failover to the secondary data center.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Real-time monitoring and alerting systems keep you informed about the status of your infrastructure.

### Deployment

To deploy this disaster recovery architecture, follow these steps:

1. **IBM Cloud Virtual Server Setup:**
    - Provision virtual servers in both the primary and secondary data centers.
    - Set up the necessary networking and security configurations.
    
2. **Data Replication:**
    - Choose a data replication method suitable for your applications (e.g., block-level replication, database replication).
    - Ensure continuous replication of data from the primary to the secondary data center.

3. **Load Balancer Configuration:**
    - Set up a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic between the primary and secondary data centers.
    
4. **Automated Failover:**
    - Develop and test scripts and procedures for automated failover to the secondary data center.
    
5. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
    - Configure monitoring tools to track the health of your virtual servers, network, and data replication.
    - Set up alerts to notify you in case of any issues or incidents.

## Backup and Recovery Procedures

Data is the lifeblood of your applications, so protecting it is crucial. Here are some key procedures for backup and recovery:

### Backup Procedures

1. **Regular Backups:** Implement a regular backup schedule, considering the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) for each application.

2. **Data Encryption:** Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit to protect its confidentiality and integrity.

3. **Offsite Backup:** Store backups in a location separate from your primary data center for added security.

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Failover to Secondary Data Center:** In case of a disaster, initiate the automated failover to the secondary data center.

2. **Data Validation:** Verify the integrity of data in the secondary data center.

3. **Failback to Primary:** Once the primary data center is operational again, implement a failback procedure to synchronize data and return to normal operations.

## Testing

Regular testing is essential to ensure that your disaster recovery plan works as expected. Conduct the following types of tests:

- **Planned Failover Tests:** Schedule planned failovers to test the failover procedures and assess the RTO.
- **Unplanned Failover Tests:** Simulate disaster scenarios to ensure the system can handle unexpected events.

## Monitoring and Alerts

Monitoring your disaster recovery setup is vital to proactively detect issues. Use monitoring tools such as IBM Cloud Monitoring to:

- Monitor server health and resource utilization.
- Track data replication status.
- Set up alerts for specific events (e.g., failovers, high resource utilization, replication lag).
